<h1>The very very best movies according to Hadya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Drop Dead Fred</h3>
<p>
    Extremely funny. <br />
    Dry humour. <br />
    For fans of Phoebe Cates as well.<br />
</p>
<h3>Farewell my concubine</h3>
<p>Superbly done. Beautiful shots. But I've never rewatched it because it's sooooo sad.</p>
<h3>Hotel Transilvania</h3>
<p>Too funny. Watch out for the scene with the golf cart!</p>
